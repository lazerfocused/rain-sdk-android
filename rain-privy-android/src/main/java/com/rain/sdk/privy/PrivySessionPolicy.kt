/**
 * Session-hardening policy for the Privy provider.
 *
 * Privy differs from Turnkey: the Privy SDK refreshes its own session internally before every
 * wallet and indexer call, and exposes no JWT expiry. So there is no proactive-refresh window
 * to configure — hardening here is auth-state guarding, a re-auth hook, and transient-failure
 * backoff. An auth failure that survives Privy's own internal refresh means the session is
 * truly dead and surfaces as `RainError.TokenExpired` (never retried by Rain).
 *
 * @param maxTransientRetries Retries (beyond the first attempt) for transient failures
 *                            (HTTP 5xx/429/408, network I/O) on idempotent reads. Writes
 *                            (sends, signing) are never retried.
 * @param initialRetryDelayMs First backoff delay; doubles per retry up to [maxRetryDelayMs].
 * @param maxRetryDelayMs Backoff ceiling.
