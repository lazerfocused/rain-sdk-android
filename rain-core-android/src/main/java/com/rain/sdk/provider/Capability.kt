/**
 * The set of optional behaviours a wallet provider may support.
 *
 * Core models capabilities explicitly so it can degrade gracefully instead of crashing when a
 * provider can't do something at all (see the modular-architecture proposal, §4 "The provider
 * port"). The port stays the lowest common denominator of what Rain needs; anything a provider
 * *might* do — but not all do — is expressed here rather than as a new required port method.
 *
 * - [EXPORT]        — the wallet's key material can be exported / backed up.
 * - [RECOVERY]      — the wallet supports a recovery ceremony.
 * - [MULTI_CHAIN]   — the provider holds accounts across multiple chain families (e.g. EVM + Solana).
 * - [BIOMETRIC_GATE]— signing is gated behind a device biometric / passkey prompt.
